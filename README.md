Sketchfab Exporter
=================

Welcome
-----------

Thank you for trying out Sketchfab Exporter! Sketchfab Exporter is a plugin for Cinema 4D
that automatically exports and uploads your 3d models to the Sketchfab.com website.

System Requirements
-------------------

Apple Mac OS X v10.6 or later.
Windows 7 or later. (Requires minimum Cinema 4D R15)
Maxon® Cinema 4d® R12 or later.

Installation
--------------------

You have two options. You can place the Sketchfab Exporter folder in your
user plugins directory (Mac) e.g: '/Users/UserName/Library/Preferences/MAXON/CINEMA 4D R1X_XXXXXXXX/plugins'.
This the recommended installation path.

You can also place it in the plugins directory located in the main Cinema 4D installation folder.
Usually, 'Applications/MAXON/Cinema 4D RXX/plugins/'. However, make sure you have the proper
permissions for the Applications directory.

Just drag the whole Sketchfab Exporter folder into either one of the above folders
and you are good to go!

How do I use Sketchfab Exporter?
--------------------------------

The Sketchfab plugin for Cinema 4D use the third party Poster module to do some of its magic. The
plugin installs the module behind the scenes without user intervention. However, it is possible that
things may not go as planned. If when starting the Sketchfab plugin, it complains about not being able
to install the necessary files, you will need to install this module manually.

1. Look inside the Sketchfab plugin folder and find a zip file called “poster-0.8.1.zip”.
   i.e Sketchfab-Exporter/res/poster-0.8.1.zip

2. Unpack the contents of the poster zip file to your python modules folder located in your
   user preferences folder for Cinema 4D.
   OS X:  /Users/UserName/Library/Preferences/MAXON/CINEMA 4D R1X_XXXXXXXX/library/python/packages/osx
   Win:  /Users/UserName/Library/Preferences/MAXON/CINEMA 4D R1X_XXXXXXXX/library/python/packages/win64

3. Restart Cinema 4D
